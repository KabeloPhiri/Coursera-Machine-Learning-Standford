# Coursera-Machine-Learning-Standford


This repository contains Python implementations of exercises from Andrew Ng's Machine Learning course.

You are required to create complete, stand-alone Octave/MATLAB implementations of certain algorithms for a number of assignments in the course (Linear and Logistic Regression for example). The remaining assignments rely on additional code supplied by the course authors. Instead, I used existing Python implementations such as Scikit-learn for the majority of the code in this repository.
